			"question": "3. In its natural condition, a soil sample has a mass of 1.980 kg and a volume of 0.001 m<sup>3</sup>. After being completely dried in an oven, the mass of the sample is 1.800 kg. The specific gravity (G) is 2.7. The unit weight of water (γ<sup>w</sup>) is 10 kN/m<sup>3</sup>. The degree of saturation of soil is ____",
			"answers": {
				"a": "0.45",
				"b": "0.51",
				"c": "0.54",
				"d": "0.65",
			}
			"explanations": {
				"a": "First we find the wet (γ<sub>t</sub>) and dry (γ<sub>d</sub>) densities as mass / volume. Next we find the water content of the soil using the formula: Water content, w = (wet density(γ<sub>t</sub>) - dry density(γ<sub>d</sub>)) / dry density(γ<sub>d</sub>). Then we determine the voids ratio as: e = (G * γ<sub>w</sub> / γ<sub>d</sub>) - 1. Finally, we obtain the saturation as: S<sub>r</sub> = w * G / e.",

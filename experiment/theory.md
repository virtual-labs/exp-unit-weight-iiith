The particle density of a soil measures the mass in a given volume of particles. Particle density focuses on just the soil particles themselves and not the volume they occupy in the soil. Bulk density includes both the volume of the solid (mineral and organic) portion of the soil and the spaces where air and water are found. 
Density is measured as mass per unit volume (mass divided by volume). Soil particle density depends on the chemical composition and structure of the minerals in the soil. Most mineral particles in soils have a particle density ranging from 2.60 to 2.75 g/cm3. However, the density can be as high as 3.0 g/cm3 for very dense mineral particles, and as low as 0.9 g/cm3 for organic particles.
Field density is defined as the weight of unit volume of soil present on site. That is where,Density of soilW = Total weight of soilV = Total volume of soil
In soils, mass of air is considered to be negligible, and therefore the saturated density is maximum, dry density is minimum and wet density is in between the two. Dry density of the soil is calculated by using equation, Where,drydensity of soil Wet density of soilw= moisture content of soil.
